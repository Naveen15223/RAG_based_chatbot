# Bharathiar University Chatbot - README

## Project Overview
The Bharathiar University Chatbot is an advanced conversational AI system designed to assist students, faculty, and visitors by providing accurate information about university-related queries. Leveraging the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the chatbot efficiently retrieves and generates responses from a vast repository of university documents, ensuring users receive timely and contextually relevant information.

## Features
- **Conversational AI**: Engages users with natural language understanding and generation.
- **RAG Framework**: Combines document retrieval with generative AI to enhance response accuracy.
- **Embedding and Vector Search**: Utilizes advanced embedding models for efficient information retrieval.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Employs various prompting techniques to handle diverse user queries.
- **User Interface**: Developed using Streamlit for an intuitive and interactive user experience.

## Project Components

### 1. Document Processing
- **Recursive Character Text Splitter**: Splits large documents into manageable chunks to optimize retrieval.
- **Embedding Generation**: Uses Google Generative AI Embeddings to convert text into semantic vectors.
- **FAISS Indexing**: Stores and retrieves documents using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient vector-based searches.

### 2. Information Retrieval
- **RAG Approach**: Retrieves relevant documents based on user queries and enhances them using a generative model.
- **Embedding Models**: Converts queries and documents into embeddings for similarity matching.

### 3. Large Language Model (LLM)
- **Generative Model Integration**: Uses GPT-based models for generating coherent and contextually appropriate responses.

### 4. Prompt Engineering
- **Prompt Types**:
  - **Zero-Shot Prompts**: General queries answered without prior context.
  - **Few-Shot Prompts**: Queries answered with examples provided to guide the response.
  - **Chain of Thought Prompts**: Encourages detailed and logical reasoning by breaking down queries into sub-tasks.

### 5. Response Generation
- **Contextual Response**: Combines retrieved documents with generated content to ensure responses are both accurate and comprehensive.

### 6. User Interface
- **Streamlit**: Provides a user-friendly interface, allowing users to interact with the chatbot seamlessly.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bharathiar-university-chatbot.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd bharathiar-university-chatbot
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Streamlit interface in your browser.
2. Enter your query in the provided input field.
3. Receive a detailed response, retrieved and generated by the chatbot using the RAG framework.

## Future Enhancements
- **Expanded Knowledge Base**: Integration of additional university documents and FAQs.
- **Multilingual Support**: Adding support for multiple languages to cater to a diverse user base.
- **Advanced NLP Features**: Incorporation of more sophisticated NLP techniques for better understanding and response generation.
- **Mobile Application**: Developing a mobile-friendly version of the chatbot.
